# Technical Tricks #

## Make sure you have the course environment enabled ##

We have a special python environment for this course which includes all the packages you need to complete the assignments. This environment should be selected automatically, but there are some situations where a terminal can open without activating this environment. If you don't see `(643_venv)` at the beginning of the command prompt in the terminal. You can activate the environment with this command:

```
source /643_venv/bin/activate
```
